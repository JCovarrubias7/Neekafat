       <h2><b>#1&nbsp Mexicola - Mad Max Music Video</b></h2>
	   <p><em>Following an experiment where I decided that the music for a Mad Max: Fury Road trailer wouldn’t fit as well as some good old Queens of the Stone Age, I took the footage from the film,  which turned out to one of the best (if not THE best) film of 2015 and cut it together to the same song: “Mexicola.”<br> This created a fast paced 5-minute version of the film to some killer music, and it’s full of editing that I’m very proud of.</em></p>
      <h2><b>#2 &nbsp Pushing Up Daisies: The Play</b></h2>
	  <p><em>The second play I wrote and directed for Argo High School’s Golden Fleece Play Festival, it follows Tom playing a Man who has recently died and is shown by the Guide, played by Mike also of Neekafat, how he can redeem himself by helping a young girl and earn his way into heaven.<br> Shot on two separate days, with an audience laughing along with you. <br>I put a lot into this, and managed to squeeze a mini-film of my own in, as well as a dance number. <br>Good times!

</em></p>
<h2><b>#3&nbsp Deserve</b></h2>
<p><em>This might be the film I’m most proud of so far. <br>It is our first fully scripted Neekafat video, and plays out its dramatic narrative with the most carefully edited and filmed work I’ve done yet.<br> Mike and Haley do beautifully here, and I couldn’t be prouder. <br>I wrote this in the summer of 2015, and it took six separate shoots from October to January to film.<br> This is by far the most work I’ve put into a film, and it was totally worth it. <br>The story and dialogue mean a lot to me, and even if the dialogue isn’t perfect, I’m still young, and I have years to perfect it.</em></p>

       <h2><b>#1&nbsp Imagination: Part V</b></h2>
	   <p><em> Me and Pablo square off again in this Imagination sequel, only this time it’s for a milkshake. <br>This is basically the beginning of the modern era of Neekafat, meaning everything that’s bad after this I can’t blame on me not knowing what I’m doing.<br> Because at this point, I kinda do. <br>It also shows the great stuff us two can do when you give us a camera and a short amount of time.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#2&nbsp Codename: 008</b></h2>
	   <p><em>This is one of my creations that I’m most proud of.<br> A four-part spoof of the James Bond franchise, it’s the most ambitious thing we attempted since Season 2. <br>It was filmed over the course of nearly our entire Season 6, and also features a large rotating cast of talented actors and unique filming locations.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#3&nbsp OST: A Silent Hill Tribute</b></h2>
	   <p><em>A homage to the "Silent Hill" video game franchise, Rhys came up with a story outline for the film.<br> After filming, he later edited different tracks of the soundtrack together, including the letter being read. <br>I then took his soundtrack and crafted the footage onto it, making one cohesive work.<br> We’re really proud of this one, it’s one of our more serious works and has great locations and a uniquely eerie touch to it.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#4&nbsp The Seconding</b></h2>
	   <p><em>A continuation of The Paradox, you would think that it would answer some of your questions about the first.<br> You would be wrong, but maybe we’ll get to that in the third one! This one does however, contain extremely absurdist and dark humor, and I think it’s one of the weirdest and funniest films we’ve ever produced.<br> The “All-Star” scene might be the funniest thing we’ve ever done in my opinion.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#5&nbsp Bunny Invasion</b></h2>
	   <p><em>In the latest (and final?) film in the Bunny franchise, me and Tom face off against the Bunny Leader and a growing amount of minions.<br> The montages and bullets fly fast in this two-part adventure.<br> This video seems to find the perfect balance of action, fine editing, and the self-serious humor that the series is synonymous with.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#6&nbsp Six-Sixteen</b></h2>
	   <p><em>This oppressively dark and mysterious puzzle of a film has a pretty funny story to it. <br>Me and Rhys were really bored one day and we wanted to film but we couldn’t think of anything. <br>So, I grabbed a couple props and we went to the location and figured it out as we were filming. <br>Essentially, the were random artsy shots we took with an underlying motive of making feelings of paranoia. <br>When we were done, Rhys made a damn creepy original soundtrack and I edited the footage to the music, much like OST.<br> I’ve actually found a few underlying meanings in it, and I’m interested every time someone thinks of something.</em></p>
	   <h2><b>#7&nbsp Season 6 Music Video</b></h2>
	   <p><em>One of the best edited videos I’ve done, and my favorite Music Video I’ve made with our own footage. <br>It’s just a blast. <br>It’s fun, not over-long, and the music fits perfectly with the hectic but occasionally serious Season 6, our best year yet.</em></p>

<h2><b>#1&nbsp The Sandwich</b></h2>
<p><em>We lost my camcorder for a day and decided to take the opportunity to make a video spoofing our own older videos, completely serious, sarcastically plotted, all about three guys fighting over what they all hold dear: A sandwich. <br>Complete with three different endings, one for each possible winner.</em></p>
<h2><b>#2&nbsp The Paradox</b></h2>
<p><em>This is a weird one, for sure.<br>This is Rhys’ first Neekafat adventure, and we make it an eventful one.<br> Time travel, closets, and possible multiple universes? Let’s go.<br> People have asked me what the ending means and I haven’t told them -- because I don’t know. <br>One person I showed it to actually came up with a way to explain it all that makes sense: but I won’t spoil it.</em></p>
<h2><b>#3&nbsp Bunny Assault</b></h2>
<p><em>Back to the basics, and who’s complaining? Not me! Me and Tom take on a horde of bunnies in the forests of Wisconsin, but one of us starts having second thoughts about it all, or is that just the evil bunny leader talking in his head?<br> Buckle up, because this whole bunny thing just got real.</em></p>
<h2><b>#4&nbsp Treasure Hunting</b></h2>
<p><em>A more expansive Which Way? video than Core Instability, with three storylines that branch out across the Wisconsin forest, beach, and cabin, as we take on the search for the missing treasure, with surprising results.</em></p>
<h2><b>#5&nbsp Nothing Crazy</b></h2>
<p><em>This is where Neekafat took its first break from the comedies and the action and started really thinking. <br>We cropped together a serious story and turned it into a psychological thriller, complete with an edgy orchestral score.<br> Tom plays a serial killer and I a doctor at his asylum.<br> There’s no sarcasm or jokes here, just dual time frames, narrations, and beautiful locations.<br> It isn’t perfect, but it was new for us, and I’m damn proud.</em></p>
<h2><b>Neekafat’s Season 4.5-5 Music Video</b></h2>
<p><em>Here it is, did you miss it?<br> Taking what the ULTIMATE Music Video missed from Season 4 and cramming that footage with all of Season 5, we get a pretty epic music video edited to the sound of Avenged Sevenfold’s classic, “Scream”.</em></p>

<h2><b>#1&nbsp Imagination: Part 4</b></h2>
<p><em>Another important shift in our style is the fourth part of the Imagination series (the others we good, if not essential, efforts from the third season).<br> It introduces a more original and complicated story, and messes around with the structure by having the first half take place after the second half.<br> Put some pretty cool action and funny moments on top of that, and you have a new standard for Neekafat.</em></p>
<h2><b>#2&nbsp Bunny Extermination</b></h2>
<p><em>Following up on last season’s video with gusto, me and Tom go up against the bunnies again in a more horror-style film than the previous.<br> The shots and gags are great for this era, and we were so proud of it that I included it in my high school’s talent show the following year.<br> Continues a trend of great sequels to this simple idea.</em></p>
<h2><b>#3&nbsp Core Instability</b></h2>
<p><em>We were very impressed ourselves with this one: a series of separate videos interlocked by <b>YouTube</b> links to create a multiple-choice story with many endings and wins, complete with its very own video-game style boss battle.<br> It’s a completely original idea, and we’ve been laughing at this one for ages.</em></p>
<h2><b>#4&nbsp Neekafat ULTIMATE Video</b></h2>
<p><em>A collection of footage from all our years of filming up to this point, this took the place of a Season music video for this year. <br>But, I will say it’s exhilarating to see all those years of filming put to one epic song.</em></p>
<h2><b>#5&nbsp Adventures in Squizardry</b></h2>
<p><em>This one is a personal favorite of mine, even though Tom hates it.<br> It’s such a random, zany, hilarious adventure that doesn’t make any sense but doesn’t have to that I can’t resist it.<br> Me playing three characters was a lot of fun, and the musical cues in this make my day. Plus, it's got one of my favorite endings of any of our films, tying the whole Harry Potter spoof in a nice little bow.</em></p>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2><b>#1&nbsp Vampire Hunters</b></h2>
<p><em>Ah, yes! A classic! I’m not exaggerating when I say this is one of the biggest turning points in my filmmaking career. <br>It finally has all the things you see in my videos today: sarcastic dialogue, mocking of its own non-existent budget, montages, and actual editing. <br>This season began right after I took my first filmmaking class, and in this video, it shows.<br> Plus, it has the best end credit sequence ever.</em></p>
<h2><b>#2&nbsp Bunny Massacre</b></h2>
<p><em>The beginning of the Bunny saga is another example proving that I had mostly figured out this editing thing.<br> It also showed that me and Tom could make a decent video with just a forest, a stuffed bunny, and mom behind the camera.</em></p>
<h2><b>#3&nbsp The Special Family: The Tenant</b></h2>
<p><em>This was part of a series of episodes that we made to model and parody conventional soap operas.<br> We made four of them, but this is my favorite.<br> It’s funny, the drama is terrible (in a good way), and it has one of my all time favorite gags -- the Turtles song with Pablo and Slushie.<br> All these add up to a great parody and a pretty fun video.</em></p>
<h2><b>#4&nbsp Season 3 Music Video</b></h2>
<p><em>Part of a tradition I’ve had since Season 2 that has me going through all of the footage from that specific season and trying to edit it impressively and dramatically to one song.<br> It’s a challenging and fun thing to do, and they usually look great.<br> This is the first one where it really worked. <br>You can see some scenes from other videos I didn’t put on the website on here, too.</em></p>

<h2><b>#1&nbsp Choo-Choo Monkey Vs Slushie</b></h2>
<p><em>Alright, progress is being made. <br>This was originally a three-part project that was (mostly) planned out before hand, and totalled out as a something-minute video.<br> That’s ambition that isn’t equalled in a long time for our channel.<br> Plus, it’s actually purposefully funny, and a lot of the filmmaking, while extremely amateur, is impressive in its simplicity that actually works.<br> There’s a lot wrong with it, but I was 12, and for that I’d say we had a clue of what we were doing.<br> (That little blurb at the end tries to explain what happened.) (And yes, that footage was ripped from Star Wars.)</em></p>

<h2><b>#1&nbsp Nightmare on Prospect St</b></h2>
<p><em>Well, this is the beginning of the Neekafat journey, or at least as far back as I care to share.<br> While this may not be our first video, it is the first one of worth and it goes far back enough to show how far we’ve come.<br> I will admit feeling some amount of pride for this one, it’s technically the best thing to come out of my first year of filmmaking.</em></p>
<h2><b>#2&nbsp Slushie</b></h2>
<p><em>This one is a doozy.<br> It was the favorite of a lot of our classmates when it came out, but I guess that isn’t saying much compared to what else was around.<br> I will admit to also be proud of this one, especially the scene with Finnian as Slushie’s mom.<br> There’s something here, you know? However little it might be.</em></p>
